<h2>About This Project</h2>
Saathi AI therapist offers a holistic approach to mental wellness through an intuitive and accessible digital platform. Our solution addresses common mental health challenges including depression, anxiety, and stress by providing diverse therapeutic tools and resources. Through a streamlined authentication process, users gain access to features like personal journaling, guided meditation sessions, and breathing techniques. The platform includes an anonymous community space where individuals can connect, share their journeys, and find mutual support. We've built this to be a safe haven where mental health can be nurtured and managed through personalized, convenient tools.

<h2>Our Solution Approach</h2>

We've integrated critical mental wellness resources into a unified, seamless experience. Upon authentication, users identify their specific mental health concerns—whether it's depression, stress, or anxiety—and receive customized tools tailored to their needs. The platform encompasses various capabilities including emotional tracking, mindfulness meditation, personal reflection journals, and calming breath work exercises that empower self-directed mental health management.

Beyond self-care tools, we've incorporated a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) assessment to help users evaluate their mental state. The platform also facilitates connections with licensed mental health practitioners and hosts a private community space where users can anonymously engage, share their stories, and receive support from peers.
